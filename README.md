##Getting Started

If you want to use this code just copy it or download the file to your machine.

Error checks for invalid inputs are generally not included for simplicity sake.

##Prerequisites

Algorithms course should have been covered in order to understand a majority of this repo, a basic understanding of Python is also required. 

##Test cases

For some of the non trivial algorithms I have included some test cases, feel free to use your own ones
